# COCO_scripts
My COCO scripts made from the weekends to help understand mutliprocessing, data visualization, and data handling methods for large data.  The large dataset by COCO and other sources is so huge that I must find ways to be able to iterate them without taking too much time.  N^2 complexity is just not feasible for this type.
